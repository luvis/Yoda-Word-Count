# Yoda-Word-Count
Simple applescript that adds a word and character count to the services menu in OSX where Yoda will count the words for you

INSTALLATION

Should be simple enough to double click and choose install. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to. It’s as simple as that.

HOW TO USE

Select any text in any application and then click Yoda Word Count in the services menu of the application.
The services menu in for example Safari will be “Safari” next to the apple and then ->Services->Yoda Word Count


WTF

This tool was created for two reasons

1. Because I needed to count the characters on a web form because they had a 500 character limit but no word count which was annoying

2. Yoda just seemed obvious
